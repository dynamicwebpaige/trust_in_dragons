Installation
------------

See doc/installation.txt for installation instructions. The impatient may
perform these three steps:

   python setup.py install
   cd kjbuckets
   python setup.py install

If you don't have a C compiler, skip the kjbuckets install step. If you're
also on Windows, then cd to kjbuckets/<your python version> and copy the
.pyd file to your python installation.

If you are using python 2.0, patch the gadly/semantics.py file with the
patch in kjbuckets/2.0
